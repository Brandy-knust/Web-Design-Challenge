                When relating the maximum temperature to the distance from the equator, we found that as the distance from the equator increased, after 23.5 degrees North, the temperature decreased. We anticipate this as we know that in winter it is colder the further north we get, but this showed with actual data the relationship. With knowledge of how seasons work, the trend up in temperatures as you go towards 23.5 degrees in the Southern Hemisphere, and then staying fairly steady makes sense. Since the Earth tilts towards the sun during summer and away from it during winter, and we tilt at an angle of 23.5 degrees, the flatter area between those numbers makes sense.
